## This is just a code visualizer!
This just simulates what the UI might be like on code. The only features this prototype includes is a visualizer of the Activities Swipe (A tinder-like menu for all the possible activities) and the Memory Log (a grid of pictures for all the activities the users have done or want to do).

In the Activities Swipe, you can "swipe" using the thumbs up and down buttons (MobileView does not allow manual swiping unfortunately). The Memory Log is just a visualizer where you can click between the tabs "Done" & "Todo"
